# Ew, Mail!
Ew, Mail! is a web browser extension that simplifies the usage of temporary email addresses from [Temp-Mail](http://temp-mail.org/).

## Introduction

Let "Ew, Mail!" handle this situation for you! Simply right click on the email field and select "Use temporary mail". This will open temp-mail.org in the background for you and automatically insert the email address into the mail field.

## Installation
Ew, Mail! is availible through the [Firefox Add-On Platform](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ew-mail/).
You can also install this extension by downloading the source from GitHub and loading the unpacked extension through "about:debugging" as a "Temporary Add-On".
